My first try building an app using Laravel with online tutorial. Consist of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). In my case here, I'm using the same model as the author of the tutorial. An app that manage posts data as in blog posts.
I could add new posts that have photo, title, and the content of the post. I also can delete and update it.
